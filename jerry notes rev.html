              is made up of: text content (what you see), markup (what it looks like), reference to other documents 
              (images, videos, etc.), and links to other pages.

        <div class="concept-description"> 
                <p>
                  CSS stands for cascading style sheets. These style sheets are what is used to determining how a page looks on the internet. You can control virtually every aspect of a page if you know the correct CSS to use. Think of it as the decorations or the style of your house.

        <div class="concept-description"> 
                <p>
                Consistency is another very good reason to avoid repetition when writing HTML code. If you want to give a document or a series of documents the same feel, then they must be coded the same. This is best done by assigning specific "classes" to each part of the document. By having different "classes" for each part of the document, you only have to change the class file in your CSS to make changes throughout the entire document.

                A computer program is a sequence of instructions written to perform a specific task with a computer.  Computer science deals with the theoretical foundations of information and computation, together with practical techniques for the implementation and application of these foundations.

                <p>
                  A web page is really just a chunk of text that comes from the Internet into your Web browser. A web page is a web document that is suitable for a web browser.  The web browser is the software program that accesses the web document and follows links to find pages in the document and displays the contents on the user's computer.  The web browser becomes the editor for coding using programming languages such as Python. You can run Python in the web browser.

                <p>
                Python is called an interpreter.  It runs programs, it interprets them, executes the programs that we wrote in Python language by running a program in a language into the computer can understand directly.  Procedural thinking is to follow the instructions in your code.  An example of Abstract thinking is seeing a Python program, Python interpreter, and a web browser as different versions of the same thing (a computer program).
                </p>
                <p>If you try to use code that is not in the Python dictionary it will return a syntax error. Python has a grammar to define what strings are in the language. It is stricter than the English language or other natural languages. With Python the code needs to match the Python grammar exactly.</p>

        <div class="concept-description"> 
                <p>
                   A function is something that takes input, does something to that input, and then produces output. For example, a function named <span class="code">sum3</span> might take 3 numbers as input and produce the sum of those numbers as output. 
                </p>

        <div class="concept-title"><h3>Making versus using a function</h3></div>
        <div class="concept-description"> 
                <p>
                  Functions are made by starting a line of code with the keyword <span class="code">def</span> and then giving a function name followed by the function <b>parameters</b> in parentheses. These parameters will eventually be replaced by actual values when the function is used (called).
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the "body" of the function, we write the code that specifies what to  do with the input parameters. For example the following code could be the definition of a function called <span class="code">sum3</span>:
                </p>  
                <div class="code-block"> <p> def sum3(a,b,c): <br>
                      <span class="indent">answer = a+b+c</span> <br>
                      <span class="indent">return answer</span>
                 </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                  To use a function, we write the name of the function followed by the value(s)    we want to give it in parentheses. Like this:
                </p>  
                    <div class="code-block">
                <p>    print sum3(1,2,3) <br>
                    >>>6

                  Functions are tools that programmers can create and reuse forever! Once you've defined a function once, you never have to define it again.  You can always refine functions so they work even better.

                <p>
                  <span class="code">Object oriented programming</span> uses interacting objects to model and solve complex programming tasks.  Since the design is modular, part of the system can be updated without a need to make large-scale changes.  OOP promotes greater flexibility and maintainability in programming, and is widely popular in large-scale software engineering. Because OOP strongly emphasizes modularity, object-oriented code is simpler to develop and easier to understand later on. Object-oriented code promotes more direct analysis, coding, and understanding of complex situations and procedures than less modular programming methods.

        <div class="concept-title"><h3>Object</h3></div>
        <div class="concept-description"> 
                <p>
                Object is a unique instance of a data structure that's defined by its class. An object comprises both data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods. <span class="code">Class objects</span> support two kinds of operations: attribute references and instantiation.
                </p>
                <p>
                <span class="code">Attribute references</span> use the standard syntax used for all attribute references in Python: obj.name. Valid attribute names are all the names that were in the class&rsquo;s namespace when the class object was created. So, if the class definition looked like this:  
                </p>
                    <div class="code-block">
                    <p>class MyClass:<br> 
                      <span class="indent">"""A simple example class"""</span> <br> 
                      <span class="indent">i = 12345</span> <br>
                      <span class="indent">def f(self):</span> <br>
                      <span class="indent2">return 'hello world'</span>
                     </p>
                     </div> 
                <p>
                then <span class="code">MyClass.i</span> and <span class="code">MyClass.f</span> are valid attribute references, returning an integer and a function object. Class attributes can also be assigned, so you can change the value of MyClass.i by assignment.  <span class="code">__doc__</span> is also a valid attribute, returning the docstring belonging to the class: "A simple example class".
                </p>
                <p>
                Class instantiation uses function notation.  Just pretend that the class object is a parameterless function that returns a new instance of the class. For example (assuming the above class):
                </p>
                     <div class="code-block">
                    <p>x = MyClass() 
                      
                     </p>
                     </div> 
                <p>
                creates a new instance of the class and assigns this object to the local variable x.
                </p>
                <p>
                The instantiation operation (&lsquo;&lsquo;calling&rsquo;&rsquo; a class object) creates an empty object. Many classes like to create objects with instances customized to a specific initial state. Therefore a class may define a special method named __init__(), like this:
                </p>
                    <div class="code-block">
                    <p>def __init__(self):<br> 
                      <span class="indent">self.data = []</span> <br> 
                    </p>
                     </div>

                <p>
                The class statement creates a new class definition. The name of the class immediately follows the keyword class followed by a colon as follows:

                The class has a documentation string, which can be accessed via ClassName.__doc__.
                </p>
                <p>
                The class_suite consists of all the component statements defining class members, data attributes and functions. <br>
                <br>
                Example<br>
                Following is the example of a simple Python class &mdash;
                </p>
                     <div class="code-block">
                    <p>class Employee:<br> 
                      <span class="indent">'Common base class for all employees'</span> <br> 
                      <span class="indent">empCount = 0</span> <br>

                      <span class="indent2">Employee.empCount += 1</span> <br>
                      <br>
                      <span class="indent">def displayCount(self):</span> <br>
                      <span class="indent2">print "Total Employee %d" % Employee.empCount</span> <br>
                      <span class="indent">def displayEmployee(self):</span> <br>
                      <span class="indent2">print "Name : ", self.name,  ", Salary: ", self.salary</span>
                      </p>
                     </div> 
                <p>
                The variable empCount is a class variable whose value is shared among all instances of a this class. This can be accessed as Employee.empCount from inside the class or outside the class.
                </p>
                <p>
                The first method <span class="code">__init__()</span> is a special method, which is called class constructor or initialization method that Python calls when you create a new instance of this class.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You declare other class methods like normal functions with the exception that the first argument to each method is self. Python adds the self argument to the list for you; you do not need to include it when you call the methods. 
                </p>
                <p>
                <span class="code">Class variable</span> is a variable that is shared by all instances of a class. Class variables are defined within a class but outside any of the class's methods.  Examples of classes that have pre-defined variables include:  <span class="code">__name__, __doc__ and __module__</span>.  Class variables are not used as frequently as instance variables are.

                <p>
                 Valid method names of an instance object depend on its class. By definition, all attributes of a class that are function objects define corresponding methods of its instances. So in our example, x.f is a valid method reference, since MyClass.f is a function, but x.i is not, since MyClass.i is not. But x.f is not the same thing as MyClass.f &mdash; it is a method object, not a function object.
                </p>
                <p>
                Usually, a method is called right after it is bound:
                </p>  
                      <div class="code-block">
                    <p>x.f() 
                      
                     </p>
                     </div> 
                <p>
                  In the MyClass example, this will return the string 'hello world'. However, it is not necessary to call a method right away: x.f is a method object, and can be stored away and called at a later time. For example:
                </p>    
                       <div class="code-block">
                    <p>xf = x.f<br> 
                      while True:<br>
                      <span class="indent">print xf()</span> <br> 
                    </p>
                     </div>  
                <p>
                will continue to print hello world until the end of time.
                </p>
                <p>
                The call x.f() is exactly equivalent to MyClass.f(x). In general, calling a method with a list of n arguments is equivalent to calling the corresponding function with an argument list that is created by inserting the method&rsquo;s object before the first argument.

                <span class="code">Inheritance</span> is the transfer of the characteristics of a class to other classes that are derived from it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Instead of starting from scratch, you can create a class by deriving it from a preexisting class by listing the parent class in parentheses after the new class name.  
                </p>
                <p>
                The child class inherits the attributes of its parent class, and you can use those attributes as if they were defined in the child class. A child class can also override data members and methods from the parent. When a method created in a sub class overrides a method created in its parent class is called <span class="code">method overriding</span>.

                  A <span class="code">module</span> is a file containing Python definitions and statements. Definitions from a module can be imported into other modules or into the main module. The file name is the module name with the suffix .py appended. Within a module, the module&rsquo;s name (as a string) is available as the value of the global variable __name__.

                Python&rsquo;s standard library is very extensive, offering a wide range of facilities which are listed in a table of contents accessible online. The <span class="code">library</span> contains built-in modules that provide access to system functionality such as file I/O that would otherwise be inaccessible to Python programmers, as well as modules written in Python that provide standardized solutions for many problems that occur in everyday programming. Some of these modules are explicitly designed to encourage and enhance the portability of Python programs by abstracting away platform-specifics into platform-neutral APIs.

        <div class="concept-description"> 
                <p>
                Abstracting something means to give names to things, so that the name captures the core of what a function or a whole program does. It works by establishing a level of complexity on which a person interacts with the system, suppressing the more complex details below the current level.  The <span class="code">abstract thinker</span> can conceptualize or generalize, understanding that each concept can have multiple meanings. Such thinkers might see patterns beyond the obvious and be able to use patterns or a variety of concrete ideas or clues to solve larger problems.

                <p>
                I was able to write a Python program (Take a Break) importing from the Python Standard Library the modules <span class="code">webbrowser</span> and <span class="code">time</span> which opened a youtube video alerting me to take a break.  The details of how to open a webbrower using the function <span class="code">def open</span> and pausing program flow using the function <span class="code">def sleep</span> were hidden from us.  The hiding of detail in programming is called abstraction.  Abstraction allowed me to focus on the program that I had to write.
